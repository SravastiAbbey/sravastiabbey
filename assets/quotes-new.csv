Thubten Chodron,Our goal is to become awakened so that we can be of the most benefit to all sentient beings.,"When working with the Dharma, it is important that we have a good motivation. Why are we following this path? What are we working toward? For Dharma practitioners, it’s important to remember that our goal is to become awakened so that we can be of the most benefit to all sentient beings. Keeping this motivation in mind can help us when we struggle, and it keeps us pointed in the right direction. $So today, let’s focus on creating that bodhicitta motivation, knowing that this is the path to real happiness for ourselves and for others. Let’s work hard to keep this motivation no matter what we encounter and to come back to it over and over as we go through our day."

Thubten Chodron,"Happiness, no matter whose it is, is something to cultivate. Suffering, no matter whose it is, is something to get rid of.","Consider our vast universe and all the enormous stars we look at: there could be all sorts of sentient beings out there in all of the six realms. Just like you, every one of those sentient beings wants to be happy and wants not to suffer. $Since we’re all alike in wanting happiness and not wanting suffering, we can’t say that we’re more important than others. Instead of making this differentiation between self and others, remember instead that happiness, no matter whose it is, is something to cultivate. Suffering, no matter whose it is, is something to get rid of."

Thubten Chodron,"At times when afflictions completely overwhelm us, it’s important to identify the afflictive state of mind and remember that it is not who we are.","This mind of ours has tremendous potential and possibility. However, at the moment, its ability and potential is covered by the clouds of mental afflictions, which are disturbing emotions and wrong views, contorted attitudes, and also the karma created under their influence. While they pollute the mind, they are not the nature of the mind. $At times when afflictions completely overwhelm us, it’s important to identify the afflictive state of mind and remember that it is not who we are. Being able to identify our afflictions in that way gives us the mental space where we can come out from under the influence of disturbing emotions."

Thubten Chodron,"Improve our own abilities, knowledge, and skill so that we can be of the greatest benefit to all living beings.","When we want to learn anything, we depend on others to learn it. Specifically, we depend on teachers and mentors. $Our fundamental teacher is the Buddha, and then we also have human beings who teach us and who lead us on the path. It’s a very special relationship we have unlike any other relationships in our lives, so it’s important to approach that relationship with the correct motivation. The best motivation is one of love, compassion, and altruism for all living beings: wanting to improve our own abilities, knowledge, and skill so that we can be of the greatest benefit to all living beings."

Thubten Chodron,Let’s take the time to develop our wisdom and skillful means so that our Dharma practice and our entire life become service to sentient beings.,"This large universe is filled with many galaxies, solar systems, and sentient beings. All except for a miniscule fraction of those beings have no access to the Dharma, so they wander around aimlessly in samsara trying to be happy. Due to self-centeredness, ignorance, anger and attachment, they instead create many causes for suffering. $So, let’s try to serve each living being as best we can, knowing that part of benefitting sentient beings entails improving our own minds. Let’s take the time to develop our wisdom and skillful means so that our Dharma practice and our entire life become service to sentient beings."

Thubten Chodron,Generate the motivation to become fully awakened for the benefit of all sentient beings.,"When we look at the night sky, the stars seem so very small to us, but for sure there are countless sentient beings out there who are wishing for happiness and freedom from suffering. When we gaze at the stars, we can let our hearts go out to all of them, knowing that no matter where they are or what life form they are, they are doing their best to be happy and free from suffering just like us. Understanding this, let’s generate the motivation to become fully awakened for the benefit of all those sentient beings."
Daniel,ks,Kindness of Others,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Qe6M4pzr0&list=PL8DRNsjySiiaU15Gr0ZX05cdzixFdlfwG&index=137,Ven. Thubten Chodron,Focus on what we have received and develop a feeling of gratitude and a wish to repay the kindness.,"Help, love, guidance, education, and so on: we have received so much kindness from other sentient beings. Even when we’ve had problems with some, thanks to the mind training teachings we can transform those problems into the path of awakening. So, let’s focus on what we have received and develop a feeling of gratitude and a wish to repay the kindness. Then, from that, let’s generate the determination to free ourselves from cyclic existence in order to work for the benefit of all those sentient beings."
Daniel,ks,Living the Practice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Qe6M4pzr0&list=PL8DRNsjySiiaU15Gr0ZX05cdzixFdlfwG&index=137,Ven. Thubten Chodron,Internalize what we’ve learned from the Dharma and put it into practice in our lives.,"It’s very important for Dharma practitioners to be on the same page in terms of our motivation. It’s important that all of us are seeking to learn how to work with our minds, to subdue our afflictions, to enrich our good qualities, to accomplish the path to supreme awakening. It’s important for everyone involved to be united in terms of our hearts and what we seek. So, with that kind of attitude, with delight, let’s internalize what we’ve learned from the Dharma and put it into practice in our lives."
Daniel,ks,Bodhicitta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Qe6M4pzr0&list=PL8DRNsjySiiaU15Gr0ZX05cdzixFdlfwG&index=137,Ven. Thubten Chodron,It is only right that we try to use our present opportunity to be of benefit to other sentient beings.,"Wherever we go, we are always surrounded by sentient beings as far as infinite space, and all of these beings are, just like us, wanting happiness, not misery. Since we have a precious human life and the opportunity to practice the Dharma, and since all these beings have been kind to us, then it’s only right that we try to use our present opportunity to be of benefit to them. $While it’s good to take care of their problems while they are in samsara, it’s even better to be able to lead them out of samsara. To do that, we first have to get ourselves out of samsara, and we have to generate all the qualities of a Buddha so that we can really be of great benefit."

Thubten Chodron,Continually remind ourselves of our long-term goal and truly use it as the basis for all that we do in our lives.,"We are fortunate in this life to have met the Dharma, to have interest in the Dharma, to have the ability to hear the teachings, and to have the time to think about, practice, and meditate on them. It’s important to appreciate this situation and to have a strong determination to make use of it and not waste it. Of course, the best way to make use of it is to generate bodhicitta and wisdom and to amass the two collections of merit and insight. $Today, let’s come back to this bodhicitta motivation over and over again. Let’s continually remind ourselves of our long-term goal and use it as the basis for all that we do in our lives."

Thubten Chodron,"Remember that our lives are short, and we can’t go back and do anything over again.","Remember that our lives are short, and we can’t go back and do anything over again. Knowing this, it’s important to make each day of our precious human life matter and not to waste our time. By some stroke of good fortune, we did not die last week or last night, so we have yet another opportunity to practice the Dharma and use our time to get ourselves out of samsara. $Let’s work hard to become awakened so that we can help all other beings out of samsara. Let’s make a determination to remember that we won’t always have this chance and so use each moment wisely and with that motivation in mind."

Thubten Chodron,"Generate a mind of compassion that wants living beings to be free from suffering, the great resolve to get involved in bringing that about, and the bodhicitta aiming for full awakening.","Let’s not have “all sentient beings” be some abstract idea that we routinely recite but have no feeling for and instead let's think of individuals. Let’s think of the whole sky filled with stars and the many living beings having many different kinds of experiences out in the universe. They all want happiness just like we do and there’s no reason why our happiness matters more than their happiness. $Let’s generate a mind of compassion that wants living beings to be free from suffering, the great resolve to get involved in bringing that about, and the bodhicitta aiming for full awakening."

In this way, we can progress on the path to full awakening in order to benefit all sentient beings. Let’s recognize when laziness, wrong views, or even a bad attitude is present in our minds and take steps to address the problem rather than becoming complacent. $Let’s always remember that we are working toward awakening not just to free ourselves from cyclic existence but so that we can help all sentient beings to find that freedom, too."

Thubten Chodron,Generate compassion for those beings who have not met the Dharma in this life and always remember our true motivation.,"We are so fortunate to be alive today. We are so fortunate to have met the Dharma in this life and to have the opportunity to practice. Sadly, countless sentient beings are not so fortunate. Let’s keep those beings in mind when working to progress on the path, and let’s work hard to become fully awakened so that we can help them. Let’s generate compassion for those beings and always remember our true motivation."

Thubten Chodron,"It’s important that we use our time wisely so, when it comes time to die, we feel we offered something meaningful to other living beings.","Even people who are terminally ill do not wake up thinking they are going to die. Just like us, they wake up thinking of plans they have made and things they intend to do. However, when karma ripens, there is no choice. $It’s important that we use our time wisely. Instead of using it to cultivate grudges, arrogance, and various mental defilements, we can instead use our time to generate compassion and cultivate wisdom so that we can make our life one that is of benefit to others. If we do, then when it comes time to die, we feel comfortable and pleased with our lives rather than having fear or regret. We feel like we had a life worth living because we offered something meaningful to other living beings."

Thubten Chodron,Let us use our situation to develop our minds and penetrate these afflictions so that we can abolish them once and for all.,"Let’s generate gratitude for all the things in our lives that help us to practice, like the electricity that keeps us warm and comfortable. This is a huge difference from what the beings in the hell realms are experiencing. We don’t even like a little bit of cold; what’s it like being born in the cold hells where it’s cold and dark for quite a long time? Thankfully, we aren’t in that situation now. We have quite the comfortable situation, so let’s use it to develop our minds and penetrate these afflictions so that we can abolish them once and for all."

Thubten Chodron,"We are fortunate that in this life we have been able to find a meaningful direction in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.","We are fortunate that in this life we have been able to find a meaningful direction rather than wandering around doing who knows what, motivated by any impulsive emotion that enters our mind. Instead, we’ve been able to find the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, to have confidence in them based on knowing what they are and trusting them, and to cultivate a relationship with them. If any other karma had ripened in this life, we could have been born in a completely different situation, and we would have been influenced by whatever environment we were born into. $So, with a sense of compassion for people born into difficult situations, let’s use the opportunity we have for this very short time to do something useful for ourselves and for them."

Thubten Jigme,"The most excellent way to make spiritual progress is to develop within ourselves, more and more, a kind and warm heart.","We won't have a better opportunity for achieving enlightenment than we have now as human beings, so it’s important that we know all the procedures for making the best use of it. The most excellent way to make spiritual progress is to develop within ourselves, more and more, a kind and warm heart. On the basis of a warm heart, we then go on to develop the dedicated heart of bodhicitta: the wish to achieve enlightenment, to eliminate all our shortcomings, and to achieve our fullest potential in order to benefit all beings as much as possible. When we dedicate our heart to others and achieve enlightenment, that’s the best use we could make of our precious human rebirth."

Let’s continually remember that and not ever give up, even when our afflictions are stronger than our antidotes. $Even when we aren’t getting as far as we’d like, as long as we keep our minds moving with the Dharma, eventually we will overcome. Let’s continue to work hard along this amazing path and keep trying to send positive energy out to a world that really needs it. Let’s follow this path to full awakening for the benefit of all beings in this universe and beyond."

Thubten Samten,Let us keep our minds infused with the motivation to become fully awakened so that eventually we can be of benefit to all beings.,"Somehow, partly in this life but also through great effort in many, many past lives, we’ve created the causes and conditions to be interested in the Dharma and to pursue that interest in this life with enthusiasm. When we look at the planet, very few people either have the interest or the causes and conditions to meet the Dharma. $So, let’s take a moment to really reflect on this remarkable opportunity that we have, and let’s keep our minds infused with the motivation to become fully awakened so that eventually we can be of benefit to all beings."

Thubten Tsultrim,"Begin with a sincere desire to benefit, regardless of what others might say.","His Holiness the Dalai Lama reminds us, “Sometimes we want to develop a certain skill or to help others, but our work does not turn out as we wished and we feel discouraged. This happens to me, too, but when I examine my motivation, my confidence returns. I begin with a sincere desire to benefit. Regardless of what others might say, knowing my motivation was genuine gives me courage and inner strength. Even though I may not be outwardly successful, I still feel satisfied.”"

Thubten Jampa,"It’s up to us to liberate ourselves from suffering, from duhkha.","It’s up to us to liberate ourselves from suffering, from duhkha. There is nobody who can do the work for us. The great master Nagarjuna said that “liberation depends on the effort of each individual, him or herself.” We have to put effort into it and use the right methods to liberate us from suffering. $This puts the responsibility on us, and it’s very easy to distract ourselves from the Dharma. We could be going to a party, watching television, or even talking endlessly about politics. One of the most effective meditations to help with this is to consider impermanence, to remember that our time is very short so that we use that time wisely in a way that will benefit others and ourselves."
